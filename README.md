### Library and packages. My own library: SM.TDP.Biblioteca

This library contains all graphics classes and some user interface elements. It contains three main packages call: graficos, imagen, iu where you can find classes related with visualitation, shape drawing and image transformations.

### App's goals. 

1. Integration and management of different types of elements: graphics, images, sounds and videos using a main menu and toolbar.
2. Geometric shapes drawing like lines, rectangles, ellipses and round rectangles using different features for each of these shapes. These features would be colour, stroke, one color fill, gradient fill (vertical/horizontal), border render or opacity.

   - Tint an image with a color.
   - Equalize an image.
   - Apply a sepia effect.
   - Apply a thresholding to the image.
   - Own image operations with a LookupOp, component to component and pixel to pixel operations.
